            <p>
                India is home to over a billion people, accommodating incredible cultural diversity between languages, geographic regions, religious traditions and social stratifications. India's culture is among the world's oldest; civilization in India began about 4,500 years ago. Many sources describe it as "Sa Prathama Sanskrati Vishvavara" — the first and the supreme culture in the world. </p>

            <h2>VALUES</h2>
            <p>
                India has a vast reserve of moral-ethical scriptures, which guided our civilization through the ages. The foundations of Indian ethics can be seen in the metaphysical and theological beliefs in the form of worship, prayers and ideals and principles of the society.

            <h2>RELIGION</h2>
            <p>
                Religion has historically influenced Indian society on a political, cultural and economic level. There is a sense of pride associated with the country’s rich religious history as the traditions of Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Jainism all emerged out of India.
